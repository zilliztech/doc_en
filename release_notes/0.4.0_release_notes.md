- Added memory object management based on Apache Arrow.
- Added GPU-accelerated mechanism to import CSV files.
- Added new chart types.
- Improved the exception handling mechanism and system stability.
- Improved the performance of computation and rendering operands.

## Infini visualized analytics interface

### System configuration and components

- Added support for importing/exporting/deleting the configuration file.
- Added the favicon system.
- Updated React to 16.10.

### Dashboards and charts

- Optimized the performance of multi-chart rendering.
- Added statistics of selected and unselected data points.
- Added bubble chart.
- Added histogram.
- Added animation effect for data changes for the pie chart.
- Added animation effect for data changes for the line chart.
- Added animation effect for data changes for the bar chart.
- Added new rendering styles for the heat chart.
- Added feature for the point map to display all information for a selected point.

### Chart editor

- Added 4 color palettes for the point map with measurements.
- Added customizable latitude.
- Added customizable measurements.
- Added new mechanism for text columns in line charts to avoid displaying too many lines. The line chart displays 10 columns by default if the number of text columns is more than 10.


## MegaWise data analytics engine

### System configuration

- Added unified configuration files for customized system configuration.

### Data interface

- Added adaptation for kudu.
- Added GPU-accelerated mechanism to import CSV files.

### SQL execution engine

- Improved support for const queries.
- Improved exception handling mechanism, including:
    - The SQL engine stops queries and recycles resources once the computation runs into an exception.
    - Improved functionality bounds checking by returning messages for unsupported SQL phrases.
- Improved the algorithm of hash join to optimize GPU memory usage.
- Added support for printing the codegen plan.
- Added support for extracting quarter.

### Memory management

- Added memory object management based on Apache Arrow.

## Picasso graphics rendering engine

- Added data rendering types, including:

    - layer\_weighted\_pointsize\_circles\_2d: Weighted 2-dimensional scatter plot with variable size and invariable color.

- Optimized the rendering speed of the heat chart.
